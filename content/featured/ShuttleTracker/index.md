Developed a React Native application integrating the Google Maps API for a shuttle tracker dashboard.

Using Twilio, I implemented a feature to send notifications to customers upon approaching their pickup location. The system leverages RFID trackers on shuttles, which ping every 10 minutes and increase frequency to every minute as they near the pickup point.

This setup ensures timely and efficient communication with passengers, enhancing their experience with real-time updates.
